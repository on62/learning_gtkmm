Learning gtkmm
==============

This is the list of known work that needs to be done to improve the Learning gtkmm website.

Note that additional example code (which is not necessarily well-suited
for beginners just starting with gtkmm imho) is also available at
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtkmm-documentation.git.
