# learning_gtkmm
This is a collection of relatively simple C++ examples that I have collected to help my students learn gtkmm in the brief class time available. The source code is published and explained on the [Learning gtkmm](https://sites.google.com/view/learning-gtkmm) website.

The examples in src have been published on the website, while those in inwork have not. 

See TODO.md if you'd like to contribute requested examples.

The license for this code was selected to match gtkmm.
